# CapstoneProject
This is the code from my Capstone Project as a University of South Carolina computer science student (graduated May 2023).
The code herein was produced by a team of myself and 4 fellow students. 
The project is a Calendar for U of SC students that web scrapes data from a number of school events, as well as letting users post their own events for all to see. 
My primary contribution to the project was both back and front end development of the calendar and event creation functionality.
